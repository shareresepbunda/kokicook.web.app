recipeingredient:
- "50 ml Bonito dashi base mentsuyu 2x concentrate"
- "40 ml Club soda"
- "2 bundles Somen noodles"
- "6 Cherry tomatoes"
- "3 leaves Shiso leaves"
- "1 dash Japanese leek"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the mentsuyu sauce concentrate and club soda in a bowl, mix together lightly and freeze for at least an hour. (You may question using the use of club soda to dilute the mentsuyu concentrate, but you don&#39;t taste the soda in it at all when it&#39;s turned into a granité.)"
- "Even if you leave it in the freezer for a long time, it won&#39;t turn into a solid block due to the carbonation. Break it up with a fork, and the granité is done."
- "Boil the somen noodles for a minute and a half, drain and cool in cold water, and drain well. Cut the cherry tomatoes into quarters, finely shred the shiso leaves and slice the leek very thinly using a slicer. Arrange the somen noodles in glasses, top with the leek, tomatoes and granité, and decorate with the shiso leaves."
