recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 cups fine or med grind corn meal or more just subtract from flour below"
- "1 1/2 cups sour cream such as daisy and 12 cup milk OR 2 cups buttermilk may not be GF"
- "1/4 cup lard veg oil works in a pinch"
- "5 tbsp butter cubed"
- "1 cup AP flour use GF or masa harina for GF"
- "2 tbsp sugar"
- "1/4 cup honey if you like it with a touch of sweetness"
- "1 tsp ea baking powder and soda"
- "3/4 tsp salt"
- "2 eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Toast cornmeal in your skillet on stove top on medium heat until fragrant, stirring frequently."
- "Mix cornmeal with your choice of dairy from above, let soak preferably overnight or at least until oven and pan are heated through."
- "Heat oven to 450. Wipe out your skillet and add your lard, place in hot oven about 10 minutes or until lard is melted and shimmering hot."
- "Carefully remove hot pan from oven and add cubed butter, swirling to combine and coat sides of skillet. Add all but about one tablespoon of oil mix into cornmeal mush, and place pan back in oven to stay hot (to get a good bottom crust)."
- "Sift together the flour, sugar, leaveners, and salt, then whisk into your wet mix. Lastly add your two eggs and honey (if using). If the mixture seems a bit stiff add some extra milk, it should be able to pour out of the bowl but with the assistance of a spatula. Using the masa harina will need some extra liquid."
- "Pour batter into hot skillet, and smooth the top. Bake for 12-15 minutes in the top half of the oven to avoid burning the bottom, and rotate once halfway through. It is done when it has browned a bit and cracking on top. Cool completely in skillet and serve from skillet, or turn out onto rack after 15 minutes. In drier climate keeping it in the skillet helps it to not dry out, however in more humid climates turning out may help keep the crust on the bottom crisp."
