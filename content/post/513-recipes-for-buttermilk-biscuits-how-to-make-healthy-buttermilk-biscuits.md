Hello everybody, it is Brad, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we're going to make a unique dish, buttermilk biscuits. One of my favorites food recipe. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sift flour and baking soda together in a large bowl; cut in shortening with a knife or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of the mixture and stir in buttermilk until a soft ball forms. Center biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet, shoulder to shoulder, so that they just touch. This is my go-to biscuit recipe for biscuits and gravy!

It can be easily made by pulsing the cubed butter into the flour using a food processor, then adding just enough buttermilk for a nice moist dough (also pulsed in using the food processor). Be sure to use parchment paper when baking. Folding creates multiple layers of dough and fat, giving rise to a tender, puffy biscuit. These homemade buttermilk biscuits are soft and buttery with hundreds of flaky layers! Big as in mega flaky, mega fluffy, mega layers, mega golden brown, mega buttery, and mega nerdy as we dive deep into this side dish sensation.
