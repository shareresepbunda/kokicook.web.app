- "100 ml approx cold water to bind"
- " For the mince meat filling"
- "2 x eating apples"
- "175 g raisins"

- "55 g candied ginger"
- "112 g beef or vegetable suet"
- "175 g brown sugar"
- "50 g chopped nuts"
- " zest and juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon"
- "150 ml brandy"
- "2 tsp mixed spice"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp nutmeg"
- "1/2 tsp orange blossom"
- "1 tsp vanilla paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "First make the mince meat which will be best after a few days or even weeks maturing in the fridge. combine nuts, dried fruit and suet in a large bowl."
- "Add sugar, brandy and spices"
- "Add zest and juice and peel and chop the apples"
- "Add vanilla and orange blossom, mix well and store in the fridge. If you are keeping the mince meat for a long time you should spoon into sterilised jars at this point. I just pressed some cling film on the surface of the mince meat to prevent oxidisation and stored in the fridge for a few days."
- "For the pastry a few days later, combine sugar with the flour, then dice the cold butter and mix thoroughly with the flour and sugar. Put this mixture now in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to chill"
- "Blend the flour sugar and butter mixture for up to 1 minute in your food processor until it appears like breadcrumb. Then add the egg and blend for just 20 second more."
- "After mixing the egg add a little cold water approx 75ml, test the dough by pressing together with your fingers and it should come together. Turn out onto your work surface and work with your hands for up to 1 minute no more (an over worked dough will form gluten and be less crumbly) I needed to add a little more water so I sprinkled some over with my fingers."
- "Form dough into a flattened ball and wrap with cling film and refrigerate for at lest 30 minutes to rest, meanwhile select a muffin or Yorkshire pudding tray, mine was deep and 7cm diameter wells."
- "I had kept my tin in the fridge before brushing with melted butter and then returned to the fridge while I prepared the pastry. I cut a quarter out and kept the remaining pastry in the fridge. Flour your work surface and rolling pin."
- "Roll the pastry to around 3mm thickness, I used a 9cm cutter"
- "You can use the pastry trimmings to re-roll once, this is a high fat pastry so will probably come back together easily but if not you can use damp hands to bring back to a dough. Select a smaller cutter for the lids. Just hold it close to the muffin tray wells to make sure it fits. Then start lining the tray."
- "Carefully press the pastry to the bottom of the wells then fill with mince meat, stir it first to make sure the fruit is evenly coated."
- "Brush a little cold water in the rim of the pastry before gently pressing the lids on, use a fork to press delicately on the rims to seal and stab a couple of holes in the top to allow steam to escape while baking"
- "Brush the tops with beaten egg and sprinkle extra sugar before baking at 190c for up to 25 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown. Turn the tray half way for an even bake."
- "The hardest part now, leave them to cool to at least just warm or room temp before removing from the tin, the pastry is very delicate when hot. But when just warm these are simply amazing I hope you enjoy and have a very happy Christmas x. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn6-Wtsi8g0&amp;t=309s"
