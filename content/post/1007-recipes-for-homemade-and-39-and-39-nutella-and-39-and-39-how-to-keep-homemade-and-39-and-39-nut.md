Hey everyone, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a Authentic dish, homemade &#39;&#39;nutella&#39;&#39;. One of my favorites food recipe. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

All you need is hazelnuts, cocoa powder, icing / confectionary sugar, oil and vanilla extract to make your very own Homemade Nutella! It tastes incredible - smoother, softer, more hazelnutty, and most importantly, it tastes so incredibly pure, free of preservatives. The Monday blues calls for homemade NUTELLA.

Homemade &#39;&#39;Nutella&#39;&#39; is one of the most well liked of current trending meals in the world. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions daily. Homemade &#39;&#39;Nutella&#39;&#39; is something which I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook homemade &#39;&#39;nutella&#39;&#39; using 4 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Homemade &#39;&#39;Nutella&#39;&#39;:

1. Prepare 20 fresh medjool dates (if dry soak them in water over night)
1. Make ready 200 grams hazelnuts (baked unsalted)
1. Take 1/2 cup water
1. Make ready 4 tbsp cocoa powder


Making Homemade Nutella seemed like as good a choice as any other. Classic Nutella is basically Chocolate- Hazelnut Spread. See, I&#39;ve never been super keen on hazelnuts, so I decided to use Marcona almonds instead. Marcona&#39;s are a Spanish almond- they are skinless, lightly fried in olive oil and salted.

##### Steps to make Homemade &#39;&#39;Nutella&#39;&#39;:

1. First blend the baked hazelnuts in blender,  then put them aside in some bowl
1. Then add the dates, cocoa powder and water in the blender and blend till u get paste
1. In the end add the hazelnuts to the date paste in the blender and blend till u get homogene paste and you are done!
1. Store in a glass jar in fridge
1. You can also make this without the nuts,  but you will have to add less water (sip the water while blending as needed)


The commercial version of this wildly popular chocolate-hazelnut spread (a classic combination in Italy known as gianduia or gianduja) is a bit too sweet for my taste, and also includes milk ingredients and not-so-healthy palm oil. So for vegans or the lactose-intolerant, this richer, darker homemade version is a great alternative. I don&#39;t buy Nutella because, truthfully, I can&#39;t be trusted with it around the house. I like it a little too much. But for some reason, when I make it at home and see the ingredients I&#39;m using before me it doesn&#39;t seem all that bad. 

So that is going to wrap it up with this awesome food homemade &#39;&#39;nutella&#39;&#39; recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am sure that you can make this at home.
