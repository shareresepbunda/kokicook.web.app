recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup flour"
- "2/3 cup sugar"
- "3/4 tsp baking powder"
- "3/4 tsp baking soda"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "1 large egg"
- "1 cup sour cream"
- "5 tbsp unsalted melted butter"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 cup semisweet chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350ºF."
- "Mix together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt."
- "In another bowl, combine the egg, sour cream, melted butter, and vanilla extract, mixing well."
- "Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix well by hand or with a mixer. I have done both and found that using my mixer to make the batter more fluffy and light really made the muffins rise more and a bit more fluffy, but didn&#39;t change the taste at all."
- "Gently add in the chocolate chips until thoroughly combined. Feel free to add more chocolate chips  :)"
- "Evenly divide the batter among the prepared cupcake liners so that the liners are about 3/4 full. Adding more to the cups will make a larger muffin top, but will increase baking time."
- "Bake until a tester inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean, about 16-18 minutes. 20-25 minutes when over filling the cups for a larger muffin top. You know your oven the best and how fast or slow it cooks, when the muffins are browning on top they are usually done."
