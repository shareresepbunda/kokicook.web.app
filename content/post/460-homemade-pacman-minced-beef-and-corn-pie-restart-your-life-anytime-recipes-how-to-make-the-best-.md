Fray Bentos annoyed fans three years ago by cutting meat amount to save costs. A long-time family favourite, this simple pie relies on making a well flavoured meat filling. Heat the olive oil in a large saut√© pan and cook the onion, carrot and celery with a good pinch of salt until very tender and just starting to brown. Easy to make, crispy and very nutritional.
