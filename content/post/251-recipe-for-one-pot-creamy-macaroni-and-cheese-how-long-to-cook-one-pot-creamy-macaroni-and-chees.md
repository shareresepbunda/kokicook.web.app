recipeingredient:
- "2 cups milk  up to 12 cup additional if needed"
- "1 cup water"
- "1 tbsp. unsalted butter"
- "2 cups elbow noodles uncooked"
- "1 tsp. ground mustard"
- "1/2 tsp. smoked paprika onion powder garlic powder"
- "1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg salt pepper"
- "1 1/2 cup (6 oz.) freshly shredded cheese of choice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by placing your milk, water, butter and uncooked pasta in a large pot over med-high heat. Allow the liquid to come to a low boil, stirring often while it heats to prevent the milk from scalding. Stir in all of the seasonings."
- "Once it begins to reach the low boil, lower the heat to med-low and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes, stirring often to prevent the noodles from sticking. If you notice that the liquid is being absorbed too quickly, add more milk in, about 1/4 cup at a time. Once the pasta is al dente, there should still be a decent amount of liquid remaining in the pot (enough to coat the pasta) and the remaining liquid should be thick and creamy."
- "Once it&#39;s done, remove the pot from the heat and immediately stir in the shredded cheese. That&#39;s it! Serve it immediately. To reheat leftovers if you have any, stir a splash of milk in before heating."
