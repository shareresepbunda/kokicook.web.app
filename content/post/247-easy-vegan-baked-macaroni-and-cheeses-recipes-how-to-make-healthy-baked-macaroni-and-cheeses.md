I just love how that top layer of smoked cheese forms like a crust. Transfer the macaroni and cheese to the prepared baking dish and top with the buttered breadcrumbs. The best southern-style baked macaroni and cheese.but without eggs, evaporated milk, and velveeta. *cracks knuckles* This may be the most requested recipe ever. I kinda get why…not too many people hate macaroni and cheese.
