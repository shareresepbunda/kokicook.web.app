recipeinstructions:
- "In a large heavy sufuria, add cooking oil over medium heat."
- "Add the strips of meat and cook each side through. (If you are like me n believe meat just has to be preboiled to cook well, then this part will take less than five mins in total. Otherwise take time to let the meat cook if it is raw)"
- "Next, add Salt, Onions, Ginger n Garlic and finally Black pepper and cook for 2 or 3 minutes. Til onion is translucent. (Be prepared to have a bout of sneezing-thanks to blackpepper ginger combi)"
- "Add stock, and bring to a boil, then add Wine and let it simmer for 5 minutes or so. This will reduce the sauce and cook off the alcohol. It will also allow the spices to fully incorporate into the meat."
- "Lastly, add cooking cream and cook for a further 5 minutes for the sauce to reduce some more and then thicken. You can cook longer if you want it to thicken even more."
- "Remove from heat and Serve hot."
