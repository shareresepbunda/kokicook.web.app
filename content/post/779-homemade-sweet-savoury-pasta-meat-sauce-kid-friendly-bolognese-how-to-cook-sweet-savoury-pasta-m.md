I don&#39;t mean to sound snobby, but I don&#39;t even call that a meat sauce. In my opinion, it takes more than adding tomato sauce into a pan of ground beef to make a real Italian meat sauce. This Bolognese sauce is dedicated to the late great Marcella Hazan. She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought &#39;Bolognese&#39; was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. Bolognese is primarily a meat based sauce, originating in Bologna, Italy.
