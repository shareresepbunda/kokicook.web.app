- "45 each Murray Coconut Bars FOUND IN THE COOKIE AISLE"
- " Filling"
- "3/4 cup Sugar"
- "1/4 cup Sugar for egg whites"

- "1 3/4 cup Toasted Coconut"
- "1 tbsp Butter"
- "1/4 cup Corn Starch"
- "2 cup Whole Milk"
- "1/4 cup Whole Milk to mix with corn starch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre heat oven to 400°F. Take coconut cookies and chop into crumbs in a food processor. Combine in deep pie dish with coconut and melted butter. Once well mixed press onto edges and the bottom of the pie plate.  Next place in the oven for 10 minutes and then remove and let cool."
- "Place the coconut on a sheet pan making sure to spread out evenly. Place in the oven and bake until they turn a golden brown. Then remove and let sit."
- "In a sauce pan, whisk together 2 cups of milk and 3/4 cups of sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.  In a seperate bowl beat the egg yolks together.  While whisking the hot milk slowly drizzle in the egg yolk. If you add too much too fast and it doesnt mix well you&#39;ll have scrambled eggs.  In a small bowl mix the 1/4 cup of milk with the corn starch to make a slurry.  Whisk the slurry into the milk mixture.  Bring the liquid up to a boil and then reduce to a simmer.  You&#39;re going to continue to cook until it thickens whisking continuously, about 4-6 minutes. Now fold in the vanilla extract, coconut extract, toasted coconut, and butter.  Pour the mixture into the pie crust and let cool completely."
- "With an electric mixer whip the egg whites to soft peaks.  Add the remaining sugar and whip until stiff peaks form.  Spread the egg whites ontop of the pie and place in the oven until the meringue is golden brown. It took me about 6 minutes, but keep an eye on it."
