recipeinstructions:

- "Mix in vanilla, salt and powdered sugar one cup at a time until completely incorporated."
- "Mix in the milk a tablespoon at a time if needed to get the consistency you like. I used only 2 tablespoons of the milk for a stiff consistency to pipe with and 3 or more tablespoons for a more spreadable consistency.  Just make sure to add a little bit at a time then mix as you go before adding more all at once. If your frosting is too runny then add more powdered sugar, a little at a time."
