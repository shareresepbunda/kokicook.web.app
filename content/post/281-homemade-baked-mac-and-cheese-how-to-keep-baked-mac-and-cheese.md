recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a  baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to aldente level. I recommend cooking the pasta a minute less than the directions.  Drain and set aside for a few minutes."
- "To prepare roux, melt butter into a medium saucepan over medium heat. Once melted whisk in flour, salt, pepper and paprika powder. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Do not mix too thoroughly, it&#39;s better left messy. To thin the sauce, add a few tablespoons of milk at a time until at desire consistency. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle with mozarella cheese over the top."
- "Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 8-10 minutes, then turn the oven to broil. Broil for about 5 minutes to brown the top. Makes 6 servings."
