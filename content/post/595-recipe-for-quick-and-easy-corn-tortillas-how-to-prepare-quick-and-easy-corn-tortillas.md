recipeingredient:
- "2 1/4 cups masa harina nixtamalized corn meal plus extra for rolling out"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 1/2 cups hot water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all the ingredients in a bowl"
- "Knead the dough until smooth, about 2 minutes. The dough should not be sticky, but also should not be too crumbly. Think the consistency of play dough."
- "You can allow it to sit covered for half an hour for a better hydrated dough, or just move onto the tortilla making."
- "Place a piece of parchment paper down on a clean, flat work surface. Sprinkle a handful of masa harina on the paper for each tortilla. Grab a fist sized ball of dough and place on paper."
- "So, most recipes call for a tortilla press. I&#39;m not making tortillas often enough to warrant the space or money spent on a tortilla pres. So find any object you can find the is approximately tortilla shaped and has a defined edge. Pictured is some cake thing I found at the local supermarket."
- "Roll out the dough as thin as you can get it without breaking. This dough is pretty cool because if it does break you can just push together and it will patch right up. If you&#39;re have trouble, grab a patch of dough from the outside, sprinkle on some water and roll out the patch. Using cylindrical cutter push down to cut."
- "Remove excess dough and cook this tortilla over medium heat in a cast iron pan (about two minutes per side). Once you get in the groove, the total cook time of four minutes should allow you to roll out a new tortilla just in time for the old one to come out of the pan."
