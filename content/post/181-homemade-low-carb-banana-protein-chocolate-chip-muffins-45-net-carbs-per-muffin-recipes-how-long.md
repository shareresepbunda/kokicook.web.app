recipeingredient:
- " Muffins"
- "3 tbsp Bobs Red Mill Low Carb Baking Mix 6 net carbs"
- "1/4 cup organic steel cut oats 23 net carbs"
- "2 scoop of Isopure banana or chocolate protein powder I use this brand because it is so low carb but there are others out there 1 net carbs"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "1/4 tsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce 55 net carbs"
- "1/4 cup nonfat plain banana or vanilla flavored yogurt I use 1 tube of Chobani snack size tubes  banana flavor 7 net carbs"
- "2 large eggs 2 net carbs"
- "6 tbsp melted cooled coconut oil or butter add 4 TBSP to batter and drizzle remaining 2 TBSP evenly into the 12 cups after you have sprayed the pan with nonstick spray 0 net carbs"
- "1 tbsp banana flavored emulsion or extract 0 net carbs"
- "6 tbsp Hershey sugarfree dark chocolate chips add to the top of each muffin just before cooking 6 net carbs"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, mix the dry ingredients together in the order above. Then add liquid ingredients in the order above. If you like, add a banana (24 net carbs) or half of a banana (12 carbs). I removed it from the recipe because I wanted to lower the carb intake. The banana emulsion does a great job of giving these muffins a nice banana flavor, so a real banana isn&#39;t necessarily unless you want to add a little potassium to your diet, which is always good for LC dieters. Those on a LC diet seem to lack potassium, so a banana can help with that, but so can supplements. Mix with electric beater. Spray non-stick cooking spray into 12 cup muffin pan. Coat it well because muffins will stick otherwise. Add batter about 1/2 way full in each cup then add chocolate chips to top. Cook at 400°F for 15-18 min. Test with toothpick around 15 min. The 15-16 min mark works for me. Be sure to refrigerate after you make these. The protein mskes them smell a little weird if you don&#39;t and besides, they taste so much"
- "You can play with the ingredients a bit and lower the net carb intake even more. Trial and error. Sometimes they will come out brown depending on what type of protein powder you use. If you use chocolate will be much more dark, but still taste great for LC. Because they are loaded with protein, they are a great on-the-go breakfast meal."
