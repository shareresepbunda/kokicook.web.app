Pineapple Upside Down Cake from Scratch. This pineapple upside down cake is dense, like a sour cream pound cake, with ground almonds in the flour to give it even more substance and a slight almond flavor. The caramel pineapple topping is so good, you&#39;ll want to pick every crumb. Cut the maraschino cherries in half, and place one half, cut-side up, in the center of each pineapple ring.

Sp oon the batter over the pineapple, gently spreading out in an even layer. Melt the butter over medium high heat in the iron skillet. Remove from the heat and sprinkle the brown sugar evenly to cover the butter. Next, arrange pineapple rings around the bottom of the pan, one layer deep. This cake is not as sickeningly sweet as some pineapple upside-down cakes and not as greasy because less butter and brown sugar are used to prepare the pan.
