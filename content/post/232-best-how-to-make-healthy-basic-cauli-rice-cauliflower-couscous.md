recipeinstructions:
- "Cook your meat first in a pan. I used a salty-garlicky sausage link called longganisa in the Philippines. This sausage gives out a lot of drippings that will definitely make the cauli rice tasty. Another good option is bacon or prosciutto."
- "Romove your meat from pan and ser aside. Lower the heat, sauté the onions then add the garlic."
- "Roughly chop your meat and add to the pan. Sauté with the onions and garlic."
- "How to prep the cauliflower: wash and dry it well using a towel. Cut into florets. Separate the stalks and remove the non-edible green leaves of course. You can use the stalks connected to the flower heads, just make sure to mince well. I used a chopper/mincer machine this time, faster! After mincing, let it air dry or squeeze through with a paper towel. We need to dry it or else it will become mushy after cooking."
- "Add portion by portion to your pan with the garlic-onion-meat. Season with salt and pepper. I added butter when the drippings were absorbed fully, and started looking dry. Keep mixing until everything is cooked."
- "Garnish with a sunny side up or scrambled egg strips. Garnish with parsely or green onions on top. I used bell pepper, it&#39;s what I had in the fridge."
- "Flavored Cauli Rice- I tried a Nasi Goreng paste. Normally it&#39;s used on rice, but it worked well with the cauli rice too. Just add a small amount, mix well."
