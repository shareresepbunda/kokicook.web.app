This simple summery avocado salad takes avocado from supporting ingredient to the main attraction. No matter how many avocado slices or cubes you mix into a leafy green salad, do you always find yourself wanting more? This salad combines fresh, ripe avocados, crisp cool cucumbers, and a light lime dressing. I love cubing them so they match the shape and size of the cucumbers, but slices are definitely an option.

Cucumber: I love using the thin-skinned varieties of cucumber in salads. Try mixing avocado with Brussels sprouts, like in this salad from Marvin Woods, chef and author of Slather baguettes with a buttery mustard spread, then stuff with avocado and slices of smoky ham. To complement a Southwestern-style meal, chef Cindy Pawlcyn serves this. Mash up half an avocado with salt, pepper and some sort of acid (lemon or lime juice) to taste. The flavors should be bright without covering up the cool grassiness of the avocado.
