recipeingredient:
- "1 tbsp salt"
- "1 tbsp turmeric"
- "1/2 tsp kashmiri chili"
- "28 oz. paneer"
- "1 red onion"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh garlic"
- "1 tsp freshly grated ginger"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh turmeric"
- "1/2 tsp ground coriander"
- "1/4 tsp garam masala"
- "1/8 tsp kashmiri chili"
- "2 tbsp ghee"
- "1 cup yogurt"
- "1.5 lbs fresh spinach"
recipeinstructions:
- "Dice paneer to 1/2 inch cubes. Toss with turmeric, salt, and chili powder and set aside to marinate."
- "Prep up all of the ingredients. It&#39;s good to have everything ready to go so you can focus on the pan. Slice the onion, chop the garlic and turmeric, grate the ginger. If you&#39;ve never worked with fresh turmeric, you just peel it with a spoon and chop it up. You can sub dry turmeric if you like. Maybe try a tsp. Turmeric is quite subtle, so it&#39;s tough to really put too much."
- "You should also puree the spinach. Toss it in the blender with a little water and chop it smooth. You can also just chop it manually if you prefer the leaves to keep a little of their shape."
- "Melt ghee in a medium sauce pan. Add the onion and stir over gentle heat until it&#39;s tender."
- "Stir in the garlic, ginger, turmeric and spices. Keep stirring over medium until the spices are toasted a bit. A lot of recipes call this the key step. This mixture should be gently toasted for quite awhile, until the onions are nearly caramelized really. You&#39;ll find that this long and gentle toasting of onion, spices, etc. is a common theme in Indian cooking. Take special care here and I&#39;m sure that after a few goes, you&#39;ll find a technique you like. But, don&#39;t let that keep you from improving."
- "Stir in the spinach, and bring to a simmer. You&#39;ll probably wanna put a lid on the pot. Pureed spinach will bubble and spatter all over the stove otherwise."
- "Stir in the marinated paneer. Again, bring it back to a simmer."
- "Add the yogurt, and adjust the salt. You&#39;re good to go."
