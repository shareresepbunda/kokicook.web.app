- "add the ground beef and ground pork and cook &#34;till lightly browned, but make sure they&#39;re thoroughly cooked. lower heat to the lowest setting and take pot/pan off the fire. take over to sink and drain most of the excess oil produced by the meat, leaving a tablesoon or so to for flavor to add to the sauce."

- "FOR MEATBALLS: Mix the ground pork, garlic and paprika (and any other seasoning or ingredient you want) and shape into round balls. I prefer them small to medium size but you can make them extra big if you want.  In a wok or a similar pan, deep fry the meatballs for about 10 min, let&#39;s say. When thoroughly cooked set aside on plate with paper towel to absorb any excess oil. Serve on each plate individually or add to sauce."
