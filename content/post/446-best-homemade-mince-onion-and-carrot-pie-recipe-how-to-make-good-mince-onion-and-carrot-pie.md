recipeingredient:
- " Shortcrust Pastry"
- "200 g Plain Flour"
- "50 g unsalted butter diced in small chunks"
- "1 splash cold water"
- " Salt to add flavour"
- " Filling"
- "500 g Minced Beef"
- "3 carrots diced or sliced"
- "1 large diced onion"
- "1 beef stock pot"
- "100 ml water"
- " Beef gravy granules"
- " Assorted herbs to season"
- "Pinch salt and pepper"
- " Extra"
- " Egg beaten with thyme"
recipeinstructions:
- "Using your thoroughly washed hands, rub together the butter cubes and plain flour, adding a pinch of salt for taste."
- "When flour and butter is consistent and looks like breadcrumbs, add a small amount of water and blend until you have a smooth dough ball. It should have an even consistency and not show any breakage. You can adjust with extra flour or water within reason."
- "Wrap dough in cling film and set aside for 15 minutes in a refrigerator."
- "Fry your mince and carrots together with onion and the stock pot, making sure to coat all the ingredients. Pepper and herbs can be added to season."
- "Once browned, add water and beef gravy granules to make your perfect consistency. I find a thicker gravy makes for a better overall pie. Leave to simmer on a low temperature while you make your pie case."
- "Take your dough, split it in two even balls and on a prefloured bench, roll two even circles of pastry."
- "Grease your tin using any suitable butter or oil spray and place one of your pastry circles in the tray to line it with the pie base."
- "Add your mince gravy to the pie, making sure to fill to the brim of the pie case bit leaving enough dough over the edge for your crust."
- "Using a pastry brush, paint the outside dough edge with your beaten egg. Place your pie lid over and cut any excess that you may have."
- "Pinch the edges of your pie together and use any excess dough to decorate however you like. Try and reroll the dough to about half the thickness of the pie case. I find this cooks the dough more evenly. Once your decor is in place, paint the whole top with more of your beaten egg."
- "Bake in an oven at 180celcius for 20-25 minutes, until the top is a golden brown."
- "Can be eaten hot or cold."
