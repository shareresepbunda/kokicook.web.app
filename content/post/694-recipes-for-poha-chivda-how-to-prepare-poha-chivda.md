recipeinstructions:
- "Roasting Poha For Chivda Recipe Measure all the ingredients and keep them separately in a plate or bowl. Heat a wide, thick-bottomed pan or kadhai with a handle. Keep the flame to a low. Then add 2 cups of thin poha or rice flakes in it."
- "Roast the poha. Gently shake the pan so that the poha gets evenly roasted, as constant stirring with a spoon might break the poha. Since they are papery, light and delicate. Within 3 to 4 minutes the poha flakes will change their texture and become crisp. Don&#39;t roast the poha on a high flame. Since on a high flame, the poha may get browned or burned. Don&#39;t brown the poha. Remove the roasted poha on a plate and place it aside."
- "Frying peanuts For Poha Chivda Heat oil for deep frying in a small pan or tadka pan. I have used a tadka pan. Alternatively, you could use a wide pan and use a fine sieve ladle to fry the nuts. Add peanuts and fry them till they become crisp. Remove them with a slotted spoon. Place in another dish or bowl. Now fry the roasted chana dal for some seconds, till they become crisp. Remove them with a slotted spoon. Place in the same dish or bowl."
- "Tempering And Mixing Poha Chivda  Heat ½ tablespoon of oil in the same pan or kadhai in which the poha flakes were roasted. Lower the flame. Add curry leaves, green chilies and a generous pinch of asafoetida. Stir and saute, till the chilies and curry leaves become crisp. Saute on a low flame. Then add sprinkle ¼ turmeric powder and 1 to 1.5 teaspoons salt or add salt as per taste. Now add 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar or sugar."
- "On a low flame, stir till the powdered sugar starts caramelizing. Then add the roasted poha along with the fried ingredients - peanuts and chana dal. Shake the pan so that everything gets mixed. If stirring, the stir gently and lightly. Saute for 4 to 5 minutes. Preferably shake &amp; mix the chivda mixture by shaking the pan. If stirring, then gently stir. Don&#39;t apply too much force while stirring else the poha flakes might break."
- "Switch off the flame. Let the poha chivda sit in the hot pan for 1 to 2 mins more. Then remove the poha chivda in another plate and let it cool at room temperature. Once cooled, then store in an air-tight box and container. Serve the chivda as a tea time snack."
