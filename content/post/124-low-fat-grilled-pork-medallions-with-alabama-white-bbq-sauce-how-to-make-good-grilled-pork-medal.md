- " White BBQ Sauce"
- " ALABAMA WHITE BBQ SAUCE"
- "4 tbsp apple cider vintage"
- "1 tbsp corn syrup"
- "3 tsp prepared horseradish"
- "2 tsp lemon juice"
- "1/2 tsp ground black pepper"
- "1 cup mayonnaise"
- " PORK MEDALLION BRINE"
- " Brine"
- "2 cup apple cider vinegar"
- "1 cup kosher salt"
- "1 cup brown sugar"
- "1 tbsp whole black peppercorns"
- "1 tbsp dry mustard"
- "4 cup cold water"
- " Ingredients"
- "1 (5 lb.) pork loin cut into medallions"
- "2 tbsp peanut oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add all of the Alabama white BBQ sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Mix well. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator over night, allowing the flavors to mingle."
- "Next you will make the brine. In a medium sauce pan, heat the 2 cups of cider vinegar. Add the salt and brown sugar. Occasionally stirring, let it come to a boil. Remove from heat. Try not to breath any of the stream that is generated. I guarantee it will knock you back."
- "Add the mustard powder and black peppercorns to the hot brine. Stir to mix. You may notice that some of the sugar and salt did not completely dissolve. That&#39;s ok. Let the brine sit for 20 minutes for the flavors to develop."
- "Transfer the hot brine to a large plastic container. Be sure to include any undissolved salt and brown sugar. Add 1 quart of cold water to help the brine cool down. I always throw in a couple of ice cubes add well."
- "Once the brine has cooled, cut the pork loin into 1 inch thick medallions and add to the brine. Be sure to trim any silver skin or excess fat. Place a small bowl or plate on top of medallions to keep them submerged. Place container in the fridge for 2-4 hours."
- "Remove the medallions from the brine. Pat them dry with paper towels and set aside. There are 2 ways I cook this depending on the time of year. In the spring, summer, and fall, I grill them on a ripping hot grill to get good grill marks and then finish them in the oven. Since it is in the middle of winter, I am going to be using my trusty ole cast iron skillet."
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Using a paper towel or brush, apply a thin coat of peanut oil to the skillet. Turn the burner temperature as high as it will go and let the skillet get ripping hot."
- "Sear the medallions on both sides, getting a nice brown crust. Place medallions in a baking dish, cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven for 30 minutes finish insides.  (This part generates a lot of smoke so open the windows. The best way to do it is on the grill or with a cast iron skillet on a propane burner outside.)"
- "Let the pork medallions rest for 10 to 15 minutes in the covered baking dish. Serve with a generous helping of Alabama white bbq sauce on top."
