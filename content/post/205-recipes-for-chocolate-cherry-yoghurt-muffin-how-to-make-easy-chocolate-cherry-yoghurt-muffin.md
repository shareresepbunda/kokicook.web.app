- "Combine by folding them gently using spatula and make sure not to over mixed them, take about 10-15 strokes just enough.

- "Check the muffin using a tooth pick when it comes to 15 minutes baking time. If it comes out with a clean surface or wet crumbs, it means it is ready to turn off the oven, ignore the remaining time. But if it comes with a wet batter, you should continue the baking process about 5 more minutes"
- "I made this one today (November 16, 2026) but they were not using the cherry yoghurt, I used plain greek yoghurt instead and I also used 1 tbs of milk powder (I sifted it along with the dry ingredients) and 1/3 cup + 1 tsp of water (mixed in wet ingredient) to replace the fresh milk, because I ran out of fresh milk in my fridge, but it still turned out really good! My mother in law loved it! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜"
