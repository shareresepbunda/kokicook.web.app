recipeingredient:
- "2.5 lbs potatoes  russet or Yukon gold are best"
- "1 (14.5 oz) can evaporated milk"
- "6 tbs unsalted butter  cubed"
- "1/2-1 tsp salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- " enough water to cover potatoes"
- "2 tsp or 2 cubes chicken bullion optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash, peel and cut potatoes to 2 inch chunks. Place in colander and rinse under cold running water to rinse off excess starch. This will help keep them fluffy. Promise."
- "Transfer to a medium/large pot. Add enough water to cover potatoes by about 1/2 inch. Add chicken bullion if desired (adds to the depths of flavor)."
- "Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cover and boil gently until potatoes are fork tender. About 12-15 minutes."
- "Drain potatoes in colander. Return potatoes to pot over low heat. Add butter, half the can of evaporated milk, 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper."
- "Use manual potato masher or handheld electric mixer to mash and blend to desired consistency. Add additional evaporated milk as needed. I generally need about 3/4 of the can. Taste and add more salt as needed."
- "Note: using the electric mixer will help provide a very smooth and creamy mashed potato, but be careful not to over mix as this can turn them gluey instead of creamy and fluffy."
