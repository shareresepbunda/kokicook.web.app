Borscht (English: / ˈ b ɔːr ʃ, ˈ b ɔːr ʃ t / ()) is a sour soup common in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. In English, the word &#34;borscht&#34; is most often associated with the soup&#39;s variant of Ukrainian origin, one of the most famous dishes of Ukrainian cuisine, made with beetroots as one of the main ingredients, which give the dish its distinctive red color. My mother&#39;s basic borscht recipe begins with a base of chopped onions, cabbage and celery sautéed in butter, fresh-pressed (or grated) garlic, a can of diced tomatoes and a few cups of chicken broth (or beef broth, or even water with a little chicken or beef bouillon added for flavour).

When I made friends, I found that many people had heard of Borscht, a traditional soup made with fresh beets, but few knew how to cook it. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until tender. Stir in the tomato paste and water until well blended.
