recipeinstructions:
- "To make the Idli: Wash the Daal thoroughly in a medium bowl until the water runs clear."
- "Soak covered in 2-3 cups of water &amp; the Methi Seeds for about 2 hours."
- "Place the Idli Rava in a large bowl.  Add 4-5 cups of water &amp; let it soak covered for about 2 hours as well."
- "Drain the water from the Daal &amp; the Idli Rava.  Grind the Daal along with the Methi Seeds &amp; 3/4th cup of freshwater."
- "Mix it with the Idli Rava. Mix well.  Cover with a tight lid or Cling Wrap &amp; leave it to ferment overnight or 8-10 hours."
- "Note: During hot summers the batter may rise in just 4 to 5 hours &amp; during winters it may take up to 16 hours or so.  Add Salt when ready to cook."
- "Heat 2 cups of water in a large pot.  Place a trivet in the pot.  Grease a 7” springform cake pan.  Wrap aluminum foil around it so that the batter doesn’t leak.   Check the level of water. It should not be over the trivet."
- "Pour the batter in the springform pan.  Place it in the pot carefully on top of the trivet when the water comes to a boil over high heat. Cover.  Reduce heat to medium. Steam for 30 minutes."
- "When done, take out carefully &amp; unmold.   Level the top with the help of a long serrated knife or cake leveler in a sawing action."
- "Place it in a plate, upside down.  Decorate if desired."

- "Meanwhile, place the cumin, coriander, fennel and caraway in a dry frying pan over high heat. Toast for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, till fragrant."
- "Remove the spices from the pan immediately to prevent burning.   Let the spices cool completely.  Coarsely grind the spices in a dry grinder or use a mortar &amp; pestle."
- "Drain the chillies, reserving a few tablespoons of the chilli water."
- "Roast the bell peppers on open flame turning frequently until charred from all sides. Let them cool completely."
- "Cut the top &amp; the membrane. Remove the seeds &amp; discard. Peel the skin. Reserve a little bit of the charred skin for a nice smoky flavor."
- "Place the garlic &amp; bell peppers in a food processor with a bit of the chilli water. Blend thoroughly. Add the chillies, spices, salt and vinegar. Process for several minutes, till smooth."
- "With the food processor running, begin adding a slow, steady stream of olive oil to the mixture. Stop adding once a paste-like consistency is achieved (you may not need all of the olive oil)."
- "Store in sterilized glass jars.  Stays good in the refrigerator for 6 months or so.   Use as required."
- "3.To make the Idli Podi: Roast the daals separately with a few drops of oil over medium heat until you get a nice nutty aroma."
- "Be extra careful not to burn them otherwise, it will alter the taste completely.  Transfer to a large plate."
- "Now, roast the sesame seeds just for about 2 minutes. That’s all it takes. Remove."
- "Finally roast the red chilies. Again chilies tend to get roasted quickly so be careful not to burn them.  Remove."
- "Once all the roasted ingredients are on the plate, add asafetida, salt &amp; sugar while still somewhat warm. Once the mixture is cooled completely, grind to a coarse powder in a dry grinder or coffee grinder."
- "Your podi is ready to be served with idlis/dosas.   Tip: Use sesame oil to mix with your podi. No other oil seems to match up to that extraordinary taste.  Store in an airtight jar. Use as required."
- "Enjoy!"
