Making shortcrust pastry can be tricky but with a lot of practice and patience, you would master it and know what works for you. I don&#39;t add eggs to my pastry as it is not necessary. Our mince pies undoubtedly have medieval origins, although we would not immediately recognise them. Pie crusts were known as coffins, and used as a vessel to cook delicate foods or house pre-boiled meat fillings.
