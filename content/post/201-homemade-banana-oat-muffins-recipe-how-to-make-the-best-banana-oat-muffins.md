recipeinstructions:
- "Start by stirring your oats into your milk in a large bowl and letting it sit for 1 hour to allow them time to soak."
- "Once the oats have soaked for at least 1 hour, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a muffin pan with liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray and set aside."
- "In a small bowl whisk together both of the flours, the ground flaxseed, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and ginger. Set that aside."

- "Pour the batter into the muffin tins and place the pan into the oven. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. You&#39;ll have a little additional batter left. I made 6 mini muffins with the remaining batter (same temperature for 8 or so minutes)."
- "Transfer the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely. As with most baked banana goods, the flavor of these is much better and more pronounced the next day."
- "Store muffins covered at room temperature for 3-4 days."
