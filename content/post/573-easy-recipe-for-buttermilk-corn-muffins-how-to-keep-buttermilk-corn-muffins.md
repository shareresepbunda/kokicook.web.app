recipeingredient:
- "1 large egg"
- "1  18 cups buttermilk plus a little more for brushing at the end"
- "1/3 cup sugar"
- "1/4 cup vegetable oil"
- "3 Tablespoons sour cream"
- "1  14 cups all purpose flour"
- "3/4 cup corn meal fine or medium ground"
- "4 teaspoons baking powder"
- "1/4 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400F."
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg, buttermilk, sugar, vegetable oil, and sour cream until they&#39;re thoroughly incorporated."
- "Sift the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, and salt into the wet mixture and stir until all the ingredients are just thoroughly combined and no more. (It&#39;s very important to resist the urge to stir the batter to a smooth consistency. When you do that, you can overwork the gluten in the flour, which results in a more dense and chewy texture to the muffin, which is not what we want here.) Let the batter sit for 10 to 30 minutes."
- "Pour the batter into 10 to 12 even portions into a buttered or lined muffin tin (I use silicone molds), and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, depending on the size (more time for fewer muffins, less time for more)."
- "If you&#39;d like a little extra browning like you see in the photo, before the last 4 minutes of baking, brush the top of each muffin with a little buttermilk. (Or you can just take a stick of butter and run it once over the tops. The heat does the melting, and I save a dirty dish. ;) )"
- "Enjoy!"
