- "This would have been fine just like this but I wanted something a little more flavorful so I looked around to see what I had. I found a bottle of go·ju·chang sauce and decided I was going to use that but I didn&#39;t want it that spicy so I made a sauce with it. I mixed in rice wine vinegar, honey, and some liquid from a jar of pickled ginger."
- "I spooned some over the salmon and green beans and then sealed the foil tightly. I baked in the oven at 400° for 20 minutes and done! * Note: It doesn&#39;t take a lot of sauce to cook with. You don&#39;t want the beans and Salmon to boil. I&#39;d say no more than a tablespoon.    I plated it up and drizzled a little more sauce over the top.   This was absolutely delicious and super easy. I served it up with a few small tomatoes and pickled ginger."
