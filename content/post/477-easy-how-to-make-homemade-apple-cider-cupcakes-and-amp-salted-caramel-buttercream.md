- "Fill cupcake liners 2/3 full and bake at 350ยบ for 19 minutes."
- "For buttercream:  In a stand mixer, cream together the butter and shortening."
- "Add the powdered sugar and the caramel alternately (add the salt in with the caramel), mixing after each addition."
- "Add milk, by the tbsp. as needed for thinning"
- "*The caramel is a little tricky just in that it needs to be the right temperature-- warm enough that it&#39;s still liquid and can blend into the buttercream, but not so hot that it melts the butter making everything too thin. Evaluate the buttercream at about 4 tbsp of caramel-- if it&#39;s getting way too thin, stop adding caramel or add more powdered sugar. I found that 6 Tbsp. was perfect for my batch."
