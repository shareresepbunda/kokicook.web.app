##### The ingredients needed to make Almond Crumble Mince Pies:

1. Take 175 g butter (usually pastry is half fat to flour but I use extra for added buttery crispness)
1. Take 2 tbsp caster sugar
1. Make ready 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1. Get 1 egg yolk
1. Get  Last-minute Christmas mincemeat https://cookpad.com/uk/recipes/480570-last-minute-christmas-mincemeat?ref=recipe
1. Prepare  For the streusel topping:
1. Take 100 g plain flour
1. Take 60 g butter, at room temperature

1. Get 50 g flaked almonds


For the crumble topping, rub the butter into the flour until crumb like. Stir in golden caster sugar and pile on top of half of the uncooked mince pies. These mince pies benefit from a boozy mincemeat filling - a little whisky is added to regular mincemeat for good measure. The vanilla almond topping is a tasty change from pastry, and might we say easier, too!
