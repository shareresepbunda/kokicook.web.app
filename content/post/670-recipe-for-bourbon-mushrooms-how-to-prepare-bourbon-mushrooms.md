recipeinstructions:
- "Cut mushrooms into bite size pieces.  They will shrink, so cut them a little bigger than you think.  Or don&#39;t.  It doesn&#39;t really matter."
- "Heat skillet with olive oil over medium heat.  You don&#39;t need a lot of oil.  Just enough to keep the mushrooms from sticking.  Probably less than you think."
- "Add mushrooms to skillet"
- "Give them a dose of Worcestershire.  Make sure they all get a good taste, but don&#39;t add enough for it to start sloshing around on the bottom with the olive oil."
- "Give a similar dose of bourbon. Be careful not to put too much moisture into the pan or it won&#39;t cook off before the mushrooms are done.  Just enough to put a splash on each one."
- "Let cook until tender.  Maybe ten minutes.  Move them around and make sure they don&#39;t burn, but they should eventually form a nice glaze."
- "About thirty seconds before they&#39;re done, add a splash of whatever beer you&#39;re drinking.  You are drinking, aren&#39;t you?"
