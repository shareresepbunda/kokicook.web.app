Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Stir the mixture with a spoon, making sure to scrape the edges of the bowl so that the dry flour there gets wet, just until the milk is incorporated into the dry mix and there are no large areas of powdery flour remaining, leaving lumpy dough which is sticky in some places and even a bit grainy in the driest areas. Don&#39;t worry, there aren&#39;t any actual cat&#39;s heads involved.

Stir in buttermilk until it is incorporated with the flour mixture.
