recipeinstructions:

- "Then, in a large bowl combine your dry ingredients using a whisk."
- "Add the butter into flour mixture and crumble with your fingers."
- "Gradually add in the buttermilk and mix with your hands until you have formed a ball of dough. If you don’t have buttermilk on hand, see step 5 for instructions on how to make your own. (I always make it from scratch for this recipe.)"
- "You can easily make buttermilk with whole milk and either lemon juice or white vinegar. For every 1/2 cup of milk you use, add 1/2 tsp of lemon juice or white vinegar; whisk together."
- "Roll our your dough, then fold in half. Roll out again, and fold once more. Then roll out the dough until it’s between 1 1/2 - 2 inches thick. (Folding the dough over builds up layers making your biscuits thicker.)"

- "Melt 2 tbsp butter and lightly brush the tops of the biscuits using a pastry brush."

- "Add the minced garlic and 1/2 onion to a pan and sauté until translucent. Once it’s translucent, add the potatoes and cook on medium-low heat for 8 minutes."
- "Now is a good time to preheat your oven to 180 degrees Celsius. (350 degrees Fahrenheit)"
- "Add the frozen veggies and cook for 4 minutes."
- "Then, pour in the chicken broth and add the diced chicken. Place a lid over the pan and stir occasionally to make sure all the pieces of chicken are cooked; cook on medium heat for 8 minutes. (Pre-cooking your chicken is also an option, however I learned from experience that when you do that the chicken tends to be a lot drier.)"
- "Once the chicken is cooked, evenly coat everything in the pan with the flour. Stir quickly to avoid lumps. Then, add the butter and stir well."
- "Pour everything into your oven safe cooking dish and put in the oven. Bake for 40 minutes."
- "C’mon!! 🤤😍"
