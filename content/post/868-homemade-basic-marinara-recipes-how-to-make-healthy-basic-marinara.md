recipeinstructions:
- "Prep all your fresh veggies by dicing your tomatoes, mincing your onion, and peeling and thinly slicing your garlic."
- "WARNING! Remember to season the veggies with only a little bit of salt and not to put too much because all the salt will add up in the end."

- "Next, sauté your tomatoes and when softened enough, use a potato masher to crush your tomatoes into a paste."

- "NOTE: If you don&#39;t have or like vodka, you can use any other hard liquor of your choice as long as you stick to a 1 part to 2 part ratio. One part hard liquor to two-part red wine. The red wine unfortunately is non-negotiable since it adds a really nice smell to the sauce. But don&#39;t feel like you have to spend it any big amount of money on either the hard liquor or the red wine, I just use the cheapest I can find and it works pretty well."
- "NOTE: And as long as your tomatoes are crushed somehow, it doesn&#39;t matter what you use to do it, you can even use a fork if you&#39;d like. Just make sure that it is thoroughly crushed into a paste."
