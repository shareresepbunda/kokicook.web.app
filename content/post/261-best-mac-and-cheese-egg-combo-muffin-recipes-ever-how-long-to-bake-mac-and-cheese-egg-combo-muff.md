recipeingredient:
- " Mac and Cheese Ingredients"
- "1/2 cup macaroni"
- "2 tbs butter"
- "2 tbs flour"
- "to taste salt and pepper"
- "1 cup warm milk"
- "3 slices bacon"
- "1/4 cup grated extra tasty cheddar"
- "1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese"
- "1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese"
- "1/2 tsp nutmeg powder optional"
- " Egg layer ingredients"
- "2 eggs"
- "3 tbs grated cheddar"
- "2 stalk chopped chives"
- " salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven into 375Â°F or 190Â°C"
- "Boiled the macaroni with a bit of salt and boiled them until less than al dente. It means, if from the instruction box you need to boil until 8 minutes, boiled them only 6 minutes, because you need the macaroni to be cooked for the second time."
- "Stir fry sliced bacon until nice and crispy about 3-4 minutes. Add a ladle of pasta water, that used for boiling pasta."
- "Make a white sauce, by adding 2 tbs of butter, melt them on a pan with medium low heat (don&#39;t burnt them or avoid to make them until brown), add 2 tbs of flour, stir them until look like a wet dough, pour the milk 3 times, 1/3 each. Give a really good mix, and if it&#39;s working too fast, you just need to mix them off your stove until all the lumps gone and well combined and back again to your stove, do the same process each time you pour in your milk until all done."
- "Season your white sauce with salt and pepper, add the cheddar, parmesan, and mozarella, into the white sauce, and you could add a nutmeg powder if you like, but if you don&#39;t just skip it."
- "Mix well your white sauce and last, add the cooked macaroni and your crispy bacon, mix them all gently until all is well combined. Set aside."
- "In the other bowl beat the eggs and grated cheddar about 1 minute and until all combined and season them with salt and pepper. Set aside."
- "Now on a muffin tray that have already been sprayed with non-stick spray, put about a table spoon of your mac and cheese into each cup."
- "After all done, fill the egg batter on the top of your mac and cheese until almost full cup. Sprinkle with chopped chives."
- "Bake them about 20-25 minutes or until the top of your egg muffins a bit brown."
- "Tips: if you find your mac and cheese a bit too salty, don&#39;t worry!!! You still have the way out, all you need to do is just by not seasoning your egg and cheese batter. It will come out with a perfect balance taste. ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜"
- "The remain mac and cheese (too lazy to prepare it again inside the muffin cups) ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚"
