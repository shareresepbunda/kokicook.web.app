recipeingredient:
- "4 cups chopped watermelon about 3 cups juice"
- "1 cup sugar syrup less or more depending upon how sweet the watermelon is"
- "1/2 lemonlime"
- "FOR THE SUGAR SYRUP"
- "1 cup sugar"
- "1 cup water"
- "FOR GARNISH"
- "few Mint leaves optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "TO MAKE THE SUGAR SYRUP: Just melt sugar and water (1:1 ratio) until the sugar has just melted. Remove from heat and cool. Use this in any dessert, drink etc. This can be stored for a few weeks in the fridge."
- "Chop, deseed and blend watermelon cubes to make about 3 cups juice. Stir in sugar syrup; start with ½ cup and keep adding more to get the right sweetness. The watermelon I used was not too sweet, so I had to add 1 cup of syrup."
- "Add juice of half lemon or lime and mix well. Pour the mixture into a wide glass/metal pan and place in the freezer to set for about 30 minutes to an hour. If needed, cover with a plastic wrap. This process is faster in a metal pan, so do check after 30 minutes if using metal"
- "After some time, you will start to see the edges and top freezing. Scrape this with a fork and mixing well into the rest of the mixture. Freeze and scrape again."
- "Repeat the process of scraping the frozen portion every few hours or even less (depending upon freezer temperature) until all the mixture is scraped and the whole mixture is frozen and flaky. The idea is to prevent ice crystals from forming."
- "Once ready to serve, scoop out the portion you want into a chilled serving glass/bowl. Garnish with mint to make it fancy and pretty and serve! Enjoy!"
- "Notes- Store leftovers in the pan, covered in the freeze; you can make this 3 days ahead. Scrape again before serving. Use the same procedure to make a variety of fruity granitas; vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free, paleo and eggless!!"
