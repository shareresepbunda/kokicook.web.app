Layer cakes are as much a craft project as they are a baking project. It&#39;s a process that requires time and patience, but the reward is totally worth it. When made and assembled properly, layer cakes are a stunning and totally impressive dessert - which is exactly what can make them seem kind of intimidating to make. It&#39;s easier than you think, though, when you know the major pitfalls to. I usually frost the cake right in the pan but you can double this recipe using two cake pans for a double-layer cake.
