recipeingredient:
- " Chicken bones"
recipeinstructions:
- "I save all my bones leftover from meals, in a Ziplock bag in the freezer.*"
- "Put your bones in the Crock-Pot. Fill to the top with water. On low, leave over night. If muscles won&#39;t release from bones, turn crockpot to high for 3 - 5 hours. Til bones can be completely cleaned"
- "Let bones completely dry for a day or 2."
- "Clean everything that isn&#39;t bone off. Lay in one layer on a baking sheet. Oven on 450°. Bake for 30 minutes to start. Remove a bone with a towel, see if you can break it. Remove smaller bones and put the rest in for another 5-10 mins. Keep an eye so nothing burns."
- "Let bones cool. Break balls off the ends. They won&#39;t grind. *I put them in my compost or straight in the soil to slow release.* Put small shards in a coffee grinder. Grind til it&#39;s a fine powder. *A mortal and pestle also works well*"
- "For thicker bones, like beef pipe bones used for my Homemade Bone Broth recipe. Flip them in the oven every 30 minutes until they crack. These are more difficult to break to small pieces, I use a sledge hammer and a metal bucket. Then grind them in a coffee grinder. Before you bake dehydrate them, clean bones completely of meat, fat, or gristle. I give them to my dogs, then find them around the yard. Also, large chunks will release slower and can be put directly in the soil.*"
