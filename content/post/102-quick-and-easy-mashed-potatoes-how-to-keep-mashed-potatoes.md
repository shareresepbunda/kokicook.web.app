recipeingredient:
- "6 medium yukon gold potatoes"
- "1 stick Butter"
- "1/2 pints heavy whipping cream"
- "1 salt"
- "1 black pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Turn your oven on to 375°F. You don&#39;t really have to preheat for this recipe."
- "Arrange your potatoes on a baking tray. Bake for about 75 -90 minutes, depending on the size of your potatoes."
- "You&#39;ll want to have your mashed potato kit ready when the potatoes come out of the oven. Slice up your stick of butter, get yourself a towel, a good bowl, a strong wooden spoon, a container for the spent tater skins, and a knife. Warm the cream gently on the stove."
- "You know your potatoes are ready when you can poke a toothpick straight through to the center of the largest potato without feeling much resistance at all."
- "Alright, it&#39;s go time! The rest of this recipe is a race. You&#39;re fighting time to get those potatoes whipped, seasoned, and on the table before they cool. Many cooks recommend performing the rest of this recipe over a double boiler in order to maintain temperature. Personally, I don&#39;t like to make things too complicated. Better just move quick."
- "With your knife in your dominant hand, use the towel to pick up a hot potato with the other. Slice a strip of skin off, and scoop the insides into your bowl. Repeat with remaining potatoes."
- "If you have a ricer available, and you like your mashed potatoes silky smooth, pass the potatoes and butter through your ricer. No ricer? Don&#39;t sweat it, just scatter the sliced butter over your potatoes and move to the next step."
- "Beat those spuds with a wooden spoon. This technique is known to many as the &#39;dead arm,&#39; technique (very little relation to the &#39;dead hand&#39; technique) and I guarantee you it is the key to elevating your mashed potato game. Swirl the spoon around in the bowl until the potatoes seem to want to form a dough. Continue beating until it feels like your arm is gonna fall off."
- "Toss in a little salt and pepper, and beat in the cream. Now, just tighten up your seasoning and don&#39;t forget to perform a final mix."
- "Get em on the table and in some bellies. Great mashed potatoes are like a great risotto. They don&#39;t know respect. They&#39;re not gonna wait for anybody, not you, not Grandma, not anybody."
