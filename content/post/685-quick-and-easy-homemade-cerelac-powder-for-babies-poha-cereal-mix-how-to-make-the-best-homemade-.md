recipeinstructions:
- "Measure and keep the ingredients ready.I have used red poha.Dry roast for few mins until it turns slightly crisp and nice aroma comes.Do not let the color change."

- "Grind it to a fine powder.You can mix both the powders well with a spoon or sieve it once."
- "Sieve it once,discard if any specks are found.Store the powder in an airtight container."
- "My Notes:  Roasting is very important so roast in low heat without changing the color.  I have used 1(poha and 1/4 gram dal) but you can have even 1:1/2.  Grind it as fine as possible and then sieve it.  If you want to feed this porridge for babies under 5months then I suggest to cook for few mins and then feed."
